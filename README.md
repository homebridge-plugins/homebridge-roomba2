## Features

- Roomba start on demand
- Roomba stop and dock on demand
- Roomba charging status
- Roomba battery level (with low battery warning)
- Roomba docked notification
- Roomba running notification
- Roomba bin full notification
- Find Roomba (Identify Function, supported in 3rd Party HomeKit apps)

The homebridge-roomba2 plugin polls Roomba for its status when requested by HomeKit, so when you first open
the Home app you may see an old status, or no status, until Roomba has had time to respond (which may take
a few seconds).

## Installation

1) Use the [Homebridge UI](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x)’s Plugins screen to search for and install "homebridge-roomba2"
2) Follow [Setup](#setup) to get Roomba credentials and to configure your Roomba
3) Restart Homebridge

### Manual Installation

1) Install Homebridge:   ```sudo npm i -g homebridge --unsafe-perm```
2) Download this plugin: ```sudo npm i -g homebridge-roomba2```
3) Follow [Setup](#setup) to get Roomba credentials
4) Enter Roomba's credentials in your `config.json` file.
5) Restart Homebridge

## Setup

1) Find your Roomba's IP address (for help see the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section); it will look like `192.168.X.XXX` or `10.X.X.XXX`, or similar.
2) Open a terminal on your Homebridge system, either using `ssh` or by using the Homebridge Terminal located in the &vellip; menu, top-right in the Homebridge UI.
3) Change into the directory where the plugin is installed: ```cd $(npm root -g)/homebridge-roomba2```
4) Type ```npm run getpassword <IP ADDRESS>``` (replacing `<IP ADDRESS>` with the IP address you discovered above).
5) Follow the instructions on screen to obtain your Roomba's `blid` and password. NB: Read the instructions carefully and ensure that you're pressing and holding the correct button on your Roomba.
6) Proceed to _Configuration_.

## Configuration

This plugin supports GUI-based configuration using [Config-Ui-X](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x), which is the recommended
approach for configuring your Roomba.

### Cleaning Mission configuration

This plugin can instruct the Roomba to clean everywhere or go on a specific cleaning job when started. Follow these steps to get the mission configuration values from the iRobot app.

1) Select the rooms you want to clean in the iRobot app, start the cleaning job, then **close the iRobot app**.
2) Open a terminal on your Homebridge system, either using `ssh` or by using the Homebridge Terminal located in the &vellip; menu, top-right in the Homebridge UI.
3) Change into the directory where the plugin is installed: ```cd $(npm root -g)/homebridge-roomba2```
4) Type ```npm run getlastcommand <BLID> <PASSWORD> <IP ADDRESS>``` (replacing `<BLID> <PASSWORD> <IP ADDRESS>` with the values for your robot).

**Note:** *Modifying the map (Room Dividers, Names or Zones) in the iRobot app will result in a new `user_pmapv_id` value and may result in new `region_id` values that will cause an error if not updated in mission configuration.*

### Deprecated configuration

The homebridge-roomba2 plugin used to support keep-alive and auto refresh modes for obtaining Roomba's status.
Both of these modes required more resources from Homebridge and Roomba than were necessary.

Now the plugin efficiently queries Roomba's status on demand so as not to slow down Homebridge and so
as to provide HomeKit with Roomba's status only when it requests it.

  <summary>Finding my Roomba's IP address</summary>

  >You can find your Roomba's IP Address in the iRobot app. Open the app and choose your Robot. Scroll down to the bottom and find Robot Settings. Click Wi-Fi Settings and then Robot Wi-FI Details. You will find your IP address and various other network goodies here.

  >Alternatively you can open up your Router Admin Panel and look for a list of devices. Once you identify the Roomba, you should see an associated IP address, however, this process will be different for each type of router.

  >While identifying your Roomba's IP address, we strongly recommend assigning your Roomba a Static IP Address (See _Roomba cannot be found after router restart OR Roomba's IP Address changed_ below).

  <summary>Roomba cannot be found after router restart OR Roomba's IP Address changed</summary>

  >If you experience issues with connecting to your Roomba, you might want to assign a **Static IP Address** to your Roomba. In order to do this, you'll need to navigate to your Router's Admin Portal and modify the configuration; because this process is different for each type of router, you will need to research this process on your own.

  >**NOTE**: If you choose to set an IP address that is different than the IP address your Roomba was previously assigned, you'll need to restart your router before the Roomba will begin responding on the new IP address.

## Building

The homebridge-roomba2 plugin uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and
[`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

`nvm` is used to control the version of node used. You can skip the `nvm` step if you manage your own
node versions.

Use `nvm` to select the required node version:

```shell
nvm use
```

or, if you don't have the required node version installed:

```shell
nvm install
```

Prepare the project:

```shell
npm install
```

Build the project:

```shell
npm run build
```

or

```shell
npm run watch
```

### Testing

The fastest way to test changes is to copy the built product directly to your Homebridge, and then to restart Homebridge.

If your Homebridge is running on your local machine, you can build (as above) and then copy the `config.schema.json` file and `dist`
folder to the `homebridge-roomba2` folder in your Homebridge's `node_modules` folder.

If your Homebridge is running on another machine, you can use a remote copy tool such as `scp` to copy the files:

```shell
npm run build && scp -r config.schema.json package.json dist user@host.local:/usr/lib/node_modules/homebridge-roomba2/
```

Note: the destination path above is an example of what the path to `node_modules` on your Homebridge server _might be_.

If you see "Permission denied" errors from `scp` you will need to adjust the permissions on the files in that folder
on your Homebridge machine.

## Contributing

The homebridge-roomba2 plugin uses [Changesets](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets) to maintain the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) and to bump the package's version number according to [semver](https://semver.org).

If you are preparing a PR, please consider using Changesets to include a summary of your change for the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md), following the example of existing changelog entries (but feel free to provide more detail).

To create a new changeset:

```shell
npm exec changeset
```

That will prompt you to indicate whether your change is a patch (a bug fix) or a minor or major change. If you are adding a feature it is a minor change, not a patch.

Changesets will create a new file in the `.changeset` directory that you can commit as part of your PR.
