### Patch Changes

- 438e99c: Add debug option to config schema

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- ae578c0: Refactor Roomba connection handling to improve reporting of issues connecting to Roomba and to reuse
  existing Roomba connections to avoid conflicts [#66]
- e7f574c: Organise config schema into sections and rename options
- 5ab1507: Increase the frequency of Roomba status checks in order to support automations
- 2863a49: Rename noDockOnStop to dockOnStop [#73 #74] (thanks @rcoletti116, @khad)

- 3e9e48b: Include a resume command when starting cleaning so we can cope with a paused Roomba
- 44c6f8a: Actively watch Roomba's status and update HomeKit for a short period of time after being inspected

  HomeKit inspects Roomba when you open the Home app, but it doesn't continously poll for changes
  so the plugin now watches Roomba for changes and pushes them to the Home app.

- 721c3a6: Add a setting to control whether Roomba is sent home when stopped [#63] (thanks @rcoletti116)

- 8ab5243: Change docking sensor to a switch so you can trigger docking
- e32d078: Add a long-term slow watching of Roomba's status so we always have a status
- 44c026c: Stop behaviour now checks what state Roomba is in and no longer triggers a docking if Roomba is already docked
- aac6159: Change state refresh approach to be on demand rather than constant polling
  or keeping a permanent connection.
- 6dbb668: Convert to using TypeScript and pnpm for development
- 853b39e: Overhauled Roomba connections and status again, status gathering is now more passive

### Patch Changes

- Enable serial number to be specified in the configuration
- Change the manufacturer reported to HomeKit to iRobot
- f71c085: Add source code linting
- 05ca4e6: Improve handling around connections to Roomba that timeout
- b3a25b0: Debug logging improvements and re-including the raw status in debug logs
- 58cba16: Improve Roomba connection handling

- 477f571: Upgrade dependencies including dorita980 to address #81

  The previous approach of updating the state directly had a race condition with pre-existing updates of Roomba's state.

- 5399dbb: Fix delay when trying to dock
- 1346008: Logging more efficient and added a switch to enable easier debug logging
